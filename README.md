# Sk-
(Solo project)

Sk - is a running app to help user to determinate how long their trainings should be in order to training for a specific run.

The data is collected through a form and analyses to determinate the trainings and their km bases on the days available to training, for how long the user can currently run and the feedback from previous trainings.
All data is being updated depending on the interaction of the user with the app. For example, if a training is deleted, the trainings from the today and the race day are equally increased in order to ensure the goal is met.

It is a unique user app and most of the code logic takes place at the back end.
